## **Background**

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information 
and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify
the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to 
manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## **Challenge**
The challenge consists of four technical analysis deliverables creating a bar chart, bubble chart, gauge with 3 customized changes to the webpage.  All charts are filtered by the Test Subject dropdown which will also list the candidates demographic info.  

### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
