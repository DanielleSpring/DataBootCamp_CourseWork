# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Basic Project Plan
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Challenge Deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

#### Software:
JavaScript, HTML, Visual Studio

#### Tools/Resources:
style.css, leaflet.css, d3 version 5, MapBox, all_week.geojson, 4.5_week.geojson, PB2002_boundaries.json";


### Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of 
earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

### Approach
The approach is to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
Leaflet library will be used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
