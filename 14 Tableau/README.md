# **Bikesharing**

## **Project Overview**

This project is an analysis of New York Citi Bike data, using data visualization tools to explore the viability of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.

### Background:

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a 
bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

### Resources
Data Source: bike_data_df.csv, 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip

Software: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public

### Challenge Deliverables:

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. The following will be submitted:

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format using pandas

Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

Data shows that the bulk of ride activity resides is concentrated in Manhatten itself.  Below illustrates by reviewing the top pick up and drop off locations for bike rentals.

August is seen to be the optimal peak rental month, where peak times are seen in the morning and afternoon commuting hours.

Based on the ridership data men make up 65.28% of all trips

The peak ridership falls within the workweek.

The trip duration tends to be shorter, falling within < 1hr which would suggest that rentals are being used for commuting for those living in Manhatten

The vast majority of male ridership stems from the subscriber model with men ranging in their 30's to 40's.
NOTE: There are some data anomolies with birth years in the 1800's. This data has been omitted to illustrate age range with men using the bike rental service below.

## **Summary**


The data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019 to be concentrated in Manhatten, with peak rentals Monday through Friday, with hours of use during the morning and evening commuting hours.   This would imply that the bike sharing service is being considered as an alternative to public transportation for young male urban professionals living in Manhattan.

Additional analysis that would be beneficial:
1) comparing data for different months to determine trends across the year
2) reviewing weather data to find the correlation between the weather and ride usage
