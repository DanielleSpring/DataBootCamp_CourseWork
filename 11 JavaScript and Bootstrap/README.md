# **UFOs**

## Overview of Project

### **Background:**
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of 
UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll 
add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### **Challenge Deliverables:**

Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)


### **Software:**
JavaScript, HTML, Visual Studio 

### **Tools/Resources:**
data.js, style.css, nasa.jpg, BootStrap

## **Results:**
This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage that allows the user to input filter criteria.  The inputs allow
the user to filter on a specific date, city, state, country, and/or shape  or a combination of any of these filters. 

 ### User Instructions for UFO Sightings website:

1) The user will manually key in the filter parameters they wish to view from the UFO data table.
2) To clear filters and refresh the webpage to view all UFO data

     -one can clear the filters manually 
  
     -OR click on the "UFO Sightings" image found in the top left hand corner of the page

## **Summary:**

While the website if dynamic, i.e the user can engage with the webpage by inputting filter criteria for viewing the data, the data itself is static and resides in the data.js file.  The webpage is not updated with new UFO sightings beyond what the current data.js file holds.   In addition, there is a lot opportunity to improve the current user experience interacting with the webpage.  Below are a few opportunitites for improvement.

1) **Improvement Opportunity:** Difficult to distinguish the placeholder info from the actual filter criteria inputs.  
   
   **Potential Solution:** italisize the placeholder text and make the user input text bold
  
2) **Improvement Opportunity:** Filter criteria inputs are case sensitive.  
   
   **Potential Solution:**  Enable bootstrap to use insensitive filtering
   
3) **Improvement Opportunity:** User knowledge of what to filter.
   
   **Potential Solution:** Allow an option for user to have a dropdown list for all filter criteria
   
4) **Improvement Opportunity:** Date selections are restricted to a single date or all
   
   **Potential Solution:** Allow user the ability to select by range
   
5) **Improvement Opportunity:** Data refresh is not intuitive for the user
   
   **Potential Solution:** Create a "Filter Clear" button to clearly articulate a data refresh feature
   
6) **Improvement Opportunity:** Webpage data displays only that data which resides in the data.js file. The file is static and new data is not added unless the file is updated.
   
   **Potential Solution:** Identify where data.js is located and updated. Link directly to this file, so that the webpage data itself stays current.
